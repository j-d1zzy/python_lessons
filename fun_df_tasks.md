# Tasks

## 1. Dwarf Class Definition
Create a Dwarf class. Each Dwarf should have a name, profession, and a happiness level. Allow these to be set during initialization and retrieved via methods. For extra complexity, add a method that allows you to change a Dwarf's profession.

## 2. Dwarf Generator

Create a function that randomly generates Dwarfs with names, professions, and a happiness level. Store these Dwarfs in a list.

## 3. Simulate a year

Create a basic simulation of a Dwarf Fortress year. Over the course of the year, Dwarfs' happiness can change - each month, roll a die for each Dwarf. On a 1 or 2, decrease happiness by one. On a 5 or 6, increase happiness by one.

## 4. Annual Report

At the end of the year, print a report of your Dwarfs - their names, professions, and happiness levels.

## 5. Dwarf Fortress Game

Put it all together. Generate a list of Dwarfs, simulate a year, then print a report.
