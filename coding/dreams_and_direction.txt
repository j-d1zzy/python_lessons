Short-term Dream (One year ish)

I would like to feel excitement about being alive. I imagine that this feels like a desire to do things for reasons other than convenience/inconvenience, or comfort/discomfort.
Feeling interested in what I am doing each day would be great. Feeling gripped. Not feeling hopeless about the future. Feeling like I'm going somewhere in life that I want to be.
