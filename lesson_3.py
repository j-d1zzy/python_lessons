# # Above is a print function. However, if you will need to print the same thing many times, you can use a variable for efficiency. 

# name = "Jordan"
# age = "29"

# print(name + " is " + age + " years old.")

# # We can use underscore to have multi-word names for variables. This is called Snake-Case and is usually all lower case.

# full_name = "Jordan Doyle"

# print(full_name)

# # We can also set multiple values to a variable at once:

# width, height = 5, 10
# print(width)
# print (height)

your_name = input("Please enter your name: ")

print(your_name)
